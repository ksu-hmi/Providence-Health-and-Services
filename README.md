Patient Portal:Coders and Contributors for Open Source Healthcare Facility 
The Application of Python in Patient-Centered Delievery 
Healthcare Facility Name: Providence Hospital 

We all have worked in the healthcare setting whether it be a primary care, in a nursing unit, pharmacy, or as a clinician. This has inspired us to use what we learned in class and attending python events to build a healthcare website. We would like to create an open source skeleton healthcare website using djingo tool and incorporate user friendly features such as u-tube, cognitive games and Spotify API that enhance the physician's ability to access patients. This also facilitates resources for pharmacists' ability to manage their pharmacy better, patients' ability to communicate with the physician, play games that improve cognitive behavior, and play their favorite music when accessing the website to making an appointment. We will have contributors and coders in this project. Providence Hospital is located in Portland Oregon. It has several nursing and pharmacy units that facilitate patient-centered healthcare delivery. 
“The problem with medicine and the institutions it has spawned for the care of the sick and the old is not that they have had an incorrect view of what makes life significant. The problem is that they have had almost no view at all. Medicine’s focus is narrow. Medical professionals concentrate on repair of health, not sustenance of the soul. Yet—and this is the painful paradox—we have decided that they should be the ones who largely define how we live in our waning days.”

   Over the past two years I have served as a liaison between patients, physicians and pharmacies, visited clinics, participated in community out-reach programs and served as an intermediator between pharmacists and patients. Simple digital and computerization will not be enough to address the growing labyrinth and complexity of effective health care delivery. Health Informatics is in its infancy and it will be years before a patient-centered system is fully developed. I myself have encountered these problems while working as a pharmacist assistant. For example, I have witnessed the discrepancy and communication barrier health care providers face with insurance companies and patients. This lack of communication emerged from lack of healthcare devices that facilitate proper patient care and consultation. There is nothing that is more frustrating than to see patients wait in line to drop of their prescription and be told that we are understaffed, waiting on the insurance claims, doctor's approval, shorthanded. Even-though computerized rx-messaging, automated refill services come available. I realized the use of python in patient care and pharmacy management this inspired me to build a website that enhances patient-centered healthcare delivery. 

Keeping an active mind – Teresa Evans 
When I worked at a hospital, I saw people at their absolute lowest points. No one really goes to the hospital on a good day. I found that one of the greatest indicators of how well a patient does was their outlook and mentality. As a nurse I have done many things to help patient cope with the emotional weight of being sick. I have cried with patients and families, researched with them about diseases, I have even made sure that patients had the drinks they prefer in stock, food that gives comfort and time to take a walk (if able) to get them out of their rooms. One thing that I have seen affect a patient’s outlook and mood the most is their access and ability to stay mentally active. The patients that read books or work on crossword puzzles tended to heal faster and have a better experience overall during their stay. In fact, it is said that patients who actively exercise their brain, have better outcomes after a stroke. Active brains build new synapse pathways. Since the neuron to neuron messages have another pathway to transmit, the damage to other pathways are felt less. In many healthcare organizations focus remains on the physical aspects of patient care. With technology and innovation wouldn’t it be great if we could focus not only on the body but on the wellbeing of the mind as well. The question that we must ask ourselves now is what would patient outcomes look like with ready access to music, education and games? My portion of this project is a game that would keep the mind active and the patient feeling accomplished. 


Keeping calm and carry on-Charles Chakkalapadavil  
Parents come from all over to have their child or to be see themselves. How can we make their time at the hospital more of an experience? Parents are nervous to bring their child into and facility and they may be on the edge. At the hospital that I currently working at, we have somebody on the intercom that call a code blue all the time. Parents may hear that and become scared. It could cause the patient to be scared as well. However, when the hospital has individual come in and play the piano and the violin it helps calms the patient. The classical music help distract the patient and parents from what it is going on. We do not hear classical music as often and so hearing it is a new change of pace. I think I would be using what I learn from my experiences in the hospital to help the patient keep calm and carry on. I will create either a Spotify API in order to help the patient feel at ease. I would be use Github and other libraries in order to help achieve my goal of making a music player. I am leaning to music player because it would be easier to create, and a Spotify account would not have to be created. I will be working on the details once we start diving into the project and seeing if it would match the type of layout we are creating for the patient and the patient family.


Keep your cool and stay in school – Christian Haygood 
YouTube can be an influential and informative tool, quickly integrating itself as an important communication medium in modern society. Because of the nature of hospital stays, I am interested in working on a service of our platform that would allow users to download YouTube videos to watch in the future. This is an important option to have, as I know from firsthand experience that hospital Wi-Fi is extremely spotty. This would allow users to download a video while the Wi-Fi is working so that they don’t have to depend on the sub-par Wi-Fi when it goes down. I think this would be beneficial for patients or patient’s family members who are still in school. YouTube is often used as an educational platform, and by downloading the videos, one would be taking their education into their own hands rather than depending on the services of the hospital to learn about a topic of interest, watch a video game tip, or even watch a cat trying to jump off of a refrigerator. I would use GitHub to implement this existing code into our software.

*4/19/2019 UPDATE*

This patient portal has since evolved to function on Flask rather than Django for simple ease-of-use reasons. The platform will provide
adequate functionality for this project and will allow us to work collaboratively on various tasks throughout the build.
